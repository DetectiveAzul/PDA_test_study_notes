#Analysis and Design
## Sofware Development Lyfe Cicles
*Original notes made by [Marta Beveridge](https://github.com/martabeveridge)*

### Waterfall

* Linear-sequential life cycle model
* First widely used
* Each phase completed before next
* Good for departmentalisation on small clear projects
* No working software until late. Bad for ongoing projects.

### Agile

* Iterative and incremental
* Each iteration 1-3 weeks
* Software built feature by feature in sprints
* Adaptable & working product early on
* Heavily depends on good customer interaction & hard to transfer to new members when project ongoing

### Prototyping

* MVP build of project
* Logic behind program may change in real production
* Used when you want to show customer the function of product
* Quick feedback & design defects detected earlier
* User can get confused between the prototype and the final product
* Devs may overly rely on previous prototypes when building product

### Spiral

* Mix of iterative and waterfall
* Waterfall + risk analysis
* Four phases: Specs / Design / Build / Evaluation.
* Iterate after every four phases. 
* Changing requisities can be acomodated
* MVP early on
* Management is complex and can spin on indefinitely, extending and extending the program

### RAD

* Rapid Application Development
* Gather requisites with workshops / focus groups
* Based on prototyping and iterative but with no specific plan
* Easy to accomodate changing req's && reduced development time
* Inapplicable to smaller projects && more managements complexity

## Use of analysis and design in the software development process

###User Interface Design
* Focus on anticipating user needs
* Ensure required interface elements are easy to access/use

###Entity Relationship Model
* Graphical representation of entities and relationship to each other
* *e.g. ONE to ONE, ONE to MANY, MANY to MANY*

###Data Design
* Takes design analysis and turns into data structures such as ERD and Data Dictionary
* Defined by Wasserman, has 7 principles

### Data Dictionary
* Set of information describing cntent, formal and structure, and use of each data element that an organization uses.
* Oracle defines as a collection of metadata

### Six Characteristics of Good Program Design

***F**ind the **R**aging **U**nicorn **E**legantly **M**oving the **P**ork*

* **F**unctionality: Suitability / Accuracy
* **R**eliability: Maturity / Fault Tolerance
* **U**sability: Understandability / Learnability
* **E**fficiency: Performance / Resource Utilization
* **M**aintainability: Changeability / Stability
* **P**ortability: Installability / Replaceability

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional: Behavioural
*E.g: A bottle functional feature is that it can contains liquid*
* Functionality
* Authentication
* Logging
* Legal requirements

### Non-Functional: Operational
*E.g: A bottle non-functional feature is the amount of liquid it can contain*
* Performance
* Scalability
* Security
* Capacity
