##Programming constructs
* **Expression:** Combination of one or more values that can be interpreted and return a value. *e.g. 2+3*
* **Sequence:** A set of instructions executed in sequence *e.g. nested for loop*
* **Selection:** A statement which has different outcomes depending on its evaluation *e.g. if statements*
* **Iteration:** A statement whih is executed repeatedly *e.g. for / while*
* **Predefined Functions:** A built-in method *e.g. puts / Sys.out.println*
* **File Handling:** - Loading / Saving files *e.g. arcade games*

##Data types
String, integer, float, double, boolean, array, hash...

##Software Testing Methods
* **Static Testing:** Examine code and documentation. No execute the code. Proofreading.
* **Dynamic Testing:** Give a test input and expect correct output. TDD.
* **Black Box Testing:** Doesn't know program functionality or the code. Simply test Input/Output
* **White Box Testing:** Looks at inside of the code/knows the code and write the tests accordingly.

##Software Testing Levels
* **Unit Testing:** Tests individual units, checks each unit performs as expected.
* **Integration Testing:** Individual units are combined and tested as a group. Exposes faults in integration.
* **System Testing:** Whole system is tested.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Tests that the system fulfills business requirement.

## OOP vs PP
*OOP* is modular and separates its components into classes. *PP* uses top-down design and instead runs commands in order. Usually the main problem is broken down in pieces.

Generally, in any big project, OOP is better as it's more manageable and collaborative. PP is suitable for smaller projects.
